MY GOAL AND  I JOINED THIS PROGRAM

First of  all my goal  is to become a software engineer .I joined this program called codehive program because it is the one program that will help me to achieve my goal of becoming a software engineer. Since it helps young women to become tech ladies in different  reputable companies and other tech industries. 

Codehive  program  also helps young women who are interested in tech ,but they can not manage to pay for expenses due to financial problems like me. Being here is a great chance for me to achieve my goal since the codehive program will help me to do that.
